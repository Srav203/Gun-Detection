# Gun-Detection
Gun Detection using OpenCV

This project detects guns in a live video stream using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. The system processes video frames, converts them to grayscale, and applies object detection to identify guns in real-time.


---

Features 

Real-time gun detection using Haar Cascade classifiers.

Draws bounding boxes around detected guns.

Live video stream processing using OpenCV.

Exits detection on pressing 'q'.

Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

imutils



---

Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Srav203/Gun-Detection.git
cd Gun-Detection

2. Install Dependencies

pip install opencv-python numpy imutils


---

Usage

1. Run the Script

python gun-detection.py

2. How It Works

The webcam captures real-time video.

The system detects guns and highlights them with blue rectangles.

Press 'q' to exit the program.

It prints "guns detected" if a gun is found.

Common Issues & Fixes

1. No module named 'imutils'

pip install imutils


2. Cascade file not found

Ensure cascade.xml is in the correct directory.

Try using the full path in the script:

gun_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(r"C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\cascade.xml")
